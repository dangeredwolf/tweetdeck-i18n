# tweetdeck-i18n v2

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/tweetdeck/localized.svg)](https://translate.moderndeck.org/project/tweetdeck)

### The unofficial free, open source project to translate TweetDeck into many languages.

This project is the *standalone* counterpart to the I18n feature used in [ModernDeck (8.0+)](https://github.com/dangeredwolf/ModernDeck).

Both operate using the exact same build process and code.

v1 was licensed under GPLv3 and v2 is licensed under MIT (hopefully more permissive to incorporate into other projects)

#### If you know other languages, please help us translate! https://crowdin.com/project/tweetdeck
